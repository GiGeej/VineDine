## About the Project
VineDine is an application that helps users discover specific recipes they can prepare using ingredients they already have at home. This program simplifies the process of meal planning and reduces food waste by offering recipe suggestions based on available ingredients.

### Features
* **Ingredients Search**: users can input ingredients in which they already have, allowing the recipes to be specific to the avaliable ingredients
* **Detailed Recipes**: The application outputs detail;ed recipes with external links to the relevant recipe selected
* **Save Recipes**: users can save the recipes to their page, allowing them to return to their favourite recipes they may want to use again
* **Drink Pairing**: each recipe will be paired with a relevant cocktail, allowing users to enjoy their meal with a specialised drink.
